I am creating a scientific publication @main.tex on the current and future risk of wildfires in the mountain of the alto adige in the Bolzano region. It requires serious updates.
I need to structure the scientific paper as standard publication : Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Result, Discussion, Conclusion

I would like to point out existing seminal publication on wildfires with a special focus on the mountain environment in the Introduction In the Methodology, I would like to point out exactly the methodology highlighted in the @Script and the data used in the @Data.

The point of the publication is to 1) show the performance of the dynamic model including the capacity to get uncertainty out of a "white model" transparent Bayesian model with two learning layers (attention mechanism) 2) the effect of the lightning data 3) the projected activities for the Forestry services based on the climate projections.

Also I need to properly set the relevant scripts and tex file in my Github <https://github.com/alexandredunant/FireScape> (which is not empty) and use it as the go to material I would like to have Scripts, Data and WriteUp (the Data are larged so not included in the Git - gitignore?). The rest of the material should be in an Archive folder which shouldn't go in the GitHub
