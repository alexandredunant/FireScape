INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

‚úÖ TEMPORAL FIT - DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED:
  ‚Ä¢ Monthly R¬≤ increased by 38.0% (0.556 ‚Üí 0.767)
  ‚Ä¢ Seasonal R¬≤ increased by 40.7% (0.579 ‚Üí 0.814)
  ‚Ä¢ Lightning model MUCH better at capturing fire seasonality
  ‚Ä¢ More accurate prediction of WHEN fires occur

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCRIMINATION - DECLINED:
  ‚Ä¢ ROC-AUC decreased by 3.8% (0.835 ‚Üí 0.804)
  ‚Ä¢ PR-AUC decreased by 21.1% (0.654 ‚Üí 0.516)
  ‚Ä¢ Reduced ability to distinguish fire from non-fire days
  ‚Ä¢ Lower precision at same recall

================================================================================
POSSIBLE CAUSES
================================================================================

1. REDUCED TRAINING DATA:
   ‚Ä¢ Baseline: 3035 observations (1999-2024)
   ‚Ä¢ Lightning: 1556 observations (2012-2024)
   ‚Ä¢ 49% less data may hurt discrimination learning

2. SPARSE LIGHTNING SIGNAL:
   ‚Ä¢ Only 6.5% of days have lightning
   ‚Ä¢ Rare events harder to learn from
   ‚Ä¢ Strong seasonal pattern but sparse occurrence

3. OVERFITTING TO TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
   ‚Ä¢ Model may prioritize seasonal fit over discrimination
   ‚Ä¢ Better at 'when' but not 'which specific days'

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

USE CASE: CLIMATE PROJECTIONS
  ‚úÖ Prefer Lightning Model
  ‚Ä¢ Temporal accuracy more important than discrimination
  ‚Ä¢ Captures seasonal shifts under climate change
  ‚Ä¢ Better for understanding long-term patterns
  ‚Ä¢ 38-41% improvement in temporal fit justifies use

USE CASE: OPERATIONAL FIRE ALERTS
  ‚úÖ Prefer Baseline Model
  ‚Ä¢ Discrimination more critical for daily decisions
  ‚Ä¢ Higher precision reduces false alarms
  ‚Ä¢ Better ROC-AUC for threshold setting
  ‚Ä¢ 3.8% better discrimination, more stable predictions

USE CASE: RESEARCH / ENSEMBLE
  üí° Use Both Models
  ‚Ä¢ Ensemble predictions for robustness
  ‚Ä¢ Lightning model for temporal trends
  ‚Ä¢ Baseline model for event discrimination
  ‚Ä¢ Combine strengths of both approaches

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The lightning model shows a CLEAR TRADE-OFF:
  ‚Ä¢ Exceptional temporal accuracy (+38-41%)
  ‚Ä¢ Moderate discrimination decline (-4% to -21%)

For climate projection applications, the lightning model is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
due to its superior ability to capture fire seasonality patterns.
